# An analysis of a surveyed perception of New York City school quality

This project looks into the perceptions of students, teachers and parents on the quality of New York City schools.

Questions looking to be answered are: 

1. What is the relationship between demography and school performance?
2. Are the perceptions related to/influenced by the demographics and success metrics of the school?
3. Do the survey respondents have similar perceptions regarding the quality of NYC schools?

The survey data can be found [here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2011-NYC-School-Survey/mnz3-dyi8) while the performance and demographics data can be found [here](https://data.world/dataquest/nyc-schools-data/workspace/file?filename=combined.csv).


### Load relevant packages

```{r setup, include=TRUE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#Loading packages
library(tidyverse)

```

### Import and preview data

```{r Data Import, include=TRUE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE }

combined<-read_csv("combined.csv")
gened<-read_tsv("masterfile11_gened_final.txt")
spced<-read_tsv("masterfile11_d75_final.txt")

glimpse(combined)
glimpse(gened)
glimpse(spced)

```

Both gened dataframe (General education schools) and spced dataframe (Special education schools), have a key (dbn) that can be matched to the combined dataframe (performance and demographics).

Special attention to rename "dbn" to "DBN" so they can match. Also note that some variables such as "principal", are not useful to this analysis. We shall drop such columns. Read the dataset dictionary for more information

The survey data is also granular, we would like to obtain aggregate perceptions of respondents for the schools in question.

The factors that respondents were surveyed on were:

- Safety and Respect
- Communication
- Engagement
- Academic Expectations

The surveyed groups were:

- Parents
- Teachers
- Students
- Total (The average of parent, teacher, and student scores)

### **Data cleaning and manipulation**

```{r cleaning,include=TRUE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE }

#Filter to remain with high school and aggregate columns only
gened_clean<-gened%>%
  rename(DBN=dbn)%>%
  filter(schooltype=="High School")%>%
  select(-2:-7,-33:-1942 )


spced_clean<-spced%>%
  rename(DBN=dbn)%>%
  filter(is.na(highschool))%>%
  select(-2:-7, -33:-1773)

#Check missing values
colSums(is.na(gened_clean)) #Two missing student respondents
colSums(is.na(spced_clean)) #One missing student respondent

#Combine the dataframes
survey<-rbind(gened_clean,spced_clean)

combined<-combined%>%
  right_join(survey, by="DBN") #right join so we only keep corresponding data that we can use to compare
  
```
Using right_join() helps keep all the survey data that corresponds to matching demographic and school performance data. 

We analyze how perception relates to demographic and school performance via a correlation matrix.

Schools in the Bronx are averaging lower SAT scores as compared to schools in Manhattan or Staten Island. This is not surprising considering the Socio-economic profile of the Boroughs in New York City.

```
<br></br>

Schools with a higher proportion of Black and Hispanic have lower SAT scores as compared to schools with a higher share of White and Asian students.This could be due to the location, programs and resources at the disposal of schools. 

Schools in boroughs like Staten Island and Manhattan would have more resources and have a higher proportion of White and Asian students as compared to schools in Bronx and Brooklyn. 

####  **How schools with special programs fair in academic performance**

The most significant observation is how drastically school performance drops with increase in number of students eligible for lunch discount at a school. This is an indication of a school being in a socially and economically disadvantaged location. Such schools rarely have enough resources to help students perform better academically.


An increase in the share of students learning to speak English is also related to lower academic performance for the school. Learning to speak English can be an indicator of share of students with a lower economic migrant background.

Creating an arbitrary cut-off of 30%, i looked into the share of schools in each borough with at least a third of its students eligible or participating in the special programs. Again, Staten Island had the fewest schools with students taking up special programs while the Bronx had the most. This matches with the socio-economic profiles of the respective boroughs.

This gap also translates to average SAT scores as shown in an earlier chart between the boroughs. 


```{r perfrom2, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align= "center", fig.width=7, fig.height=6}

  as_tibble(rownames="variable")#A tibble for easier viewing


#Variables with strong relationship with Avg sat score
strong_cor<-cor_tib%>%
  select(variable, Avg_SAT_score)%>%
  filter(Avg_SAT_score  < -0.25|Avg_SAT_score >0.25)


strong_cor_mat<-as.matrix(strong_cor)

#Plot matrix table to see strength of relationships
fig4 <- ggcorrplot(
  cor_mat, hc.order = TRUE, type = "lower", title = "Correlation matrix between school \nperformance and demographics", outline.col = "white",
  p.mat = p.mat)

```

<center>
```{r include=TRUE, echo=FALSE,fig.align= "center",warning=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
fig4<-ggplotly(fig4)
fig4
```
</center>


A correlation analysis shows how strong the relationships between racial diversity and school programs are with the academic performance of the school.

When it comes to demographics, academic performance shows a strong positive correlation with the percentage of white students in a school (r= 0.65). While it has the strongest negative relationship with the percentage of students that are eligible for food discount at a school (r= -0.72).

Overall, the strongest positive relationships are among the perceptions of NYC schools. The respondents (teachers, students and parents) of the survey seem to have correlating perceptions of how NYC schools perform when it comes to academic performance, communication, engagement and safety. 

####  **How teachers, students and parents rate NYC schools** 

```{r rating, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align= "center", fig.width=7, fig.height=5}

  pivot_longer(cols = c(parent_score_avg, teacher_score_avg, student_score_avg),

       x="Respondent")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))+

```


<br><br>
Overall, parents seem to rate NYC schools the highest while students (not surprisingly `r emo::ji("smile")`) are rating the schools lowest. Teachers show the most broad rating of NYC schools. 


####  **Survey responses on quality of NYC schools**

```{r questions, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align= "center", fig.width=8, fig.height=6}

#Pivot table longer to establish individual rating per question type
que_score<-combined%>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(saf_p_11:aca_s_11),
               names_to="questions",
               values_to="rating")

#Create variables out of the pivoted column
que_score <- que_score %>%
  mutate(respondent = str_sub(questions, 4, 6)) %>%   
  mutate(question = str_sub(questions, 1, 3))


que_score <- que_score%>%
  mutate(respondent = ifelse(respondent  == "_p_", "parent", 
                                ifelse(respondent  == "_t_", "teacher",
                                       ifelse(respondent  == "_s_", "student", 
                                              ifelse(respondent  == "_to", "total", "NA")))))


#Boxplot to see if there appear to be differences in how the three groups of responders (parents, students, and teachers) answered the four questions. 

que_score<-as.data.frame(que_score)

fig6<-plot_ly(data = que_score, x=~question, y =~rating, color =~respondent, 
        type = "box") %>% 
         layout(boxmode = "group", title="<b>NYC School quality perception survey questions and responses<b>",
         xaxis = list(title='survey questions',
                      ticktext = list("Academic \nExpectations", "Communication", "Engagement", "Safety and \nRespect"), 
      tickvals = list("aca","com","eng","saf"), 
         yaxis = list(title='Percentage')))

fig6

```

<br><br>

Looking on how individual groups responded, the best rating was for **safety and respect** by parent respondents and the lowest was for **communication** by student respondents.

Interesting to note that across each borough, the responses to the survey were somewhat similar. The box plot below shows how even the worst academically performing borough (Bronx) has half the respondents rating schools at a score of 7.17 while Staten Island, which is better off academically and economically has half the respondents scoring their schools at 7.30 rating.



```{r boro, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align= "center", fig.width=7, fig.height=5}
#establish average scores per respondent group

survey_score<-combined%>%
  mutate(parent_score_avg=(saf_p_11+com_p_11+eng_p_11+aca_p_11)/4)%>%
  mutate(teacher_score_avg=(saf_t_11+com_t_11+eng_t_11+aca_t_11)/4)%>%
  mutate(student_score_avg=(saf_s_11+com_s_11+eng_s_11+aca_s_11)/4)

#Pivot table longer to make it easier to plot on same scatter plot
survey_score_longer<-survey_score%>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(parent_score_avg, teacher_score_avg, student_score_avg),
               names_to= "respondent",
               values_to= "avg_score")


#Plot the spread of the respondents average scores
boro<-survey_score_longer%>%
  drop_na(boro)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=boro, y=avg_score, fill=boro))+
  geom_boxplot(show.legend = FALSE)+
  labs(title = "<b>Perception of NYC schools quality \nby Borough (survey responses)</b>",
       y="Average rating",
       x="Borough")+
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
  

boro<-ggplotly(boro)
boro<-hide_legend(boro)
boro
```

This proves what we saw in the correlation matrix, that how respondents rated schools do not have a strong correlation nor a statistically significant one with actual school performance. But how respondents rated schools do closely correlate to each other. 

This could mean there is a perception bubble amongst teachers, studnets and parents. Sadly, it does not match reality. 


Perceptions are a funny thing.
